#Angular 2 5-Minute Quickstart using Webpack

That is a mouthful, but it is fairly straightforward.  Instead of using SystemJS like the tutorial says, it uses Webpack.
I created this because of my personal preference of using something I know vs something I didn't.  I followed the tutorials
on the Angular.io site about integrating with Webpack and it looks like it is working the way it should.  I will probably update this
monthly to add update versions and semantics as they change.
